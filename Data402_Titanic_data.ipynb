By this we mean stuff that is already assumed to be the case by another column. Take the columns \"survived\" and \"alive\" for example. Both are yes and no answers, just one is written with 0 and 1 (False and True) and the other with text. It is obvious that any value with \"survived\" as \"0\" is not going to have \"alive\" as \"yes\", so since we already know the information we need from this, we can drop one of these columns (we have chosen to remove \"alive\" for the sake of this example, but either one is fine to remove).\n",

We can modify some headers to be easier to understand and modify some others to just change the wording (not because they are hard to understand necessarily, but just to be a bit clearer in general)."
